### **getting started with Minecraft in the classroom**

---

![bg left:50% 155%](https://education.minecraft.net/content/dam/education-edition/screenshots/MC-EDU_Blog-Image_Impact-of-Minecraft-in-the-Math-Classroom_800x600.jpg)

[Minecraft Education](https://education.minecraft.net/) is an educational version of the popular game Minecraft

special blocks and a coding platform have been introduced to facilitate learning

---

# Why use it in the classroom?

- Problem solving in a 3D environment
- Allow students to learn and explore in a virtual 3D world. 
- Students can **construct** understanding literally with building tasks
- A community of teachers are already using ME, there's already a vast library of resources and lessons

---

# Unique Behavioural challenges

Students:

- will know more about the base game than you
- have expectations about what Minecraft should involve 
- are keen for multiplayer expereiences but expectations need to be managed well
- see digital social interaction differently to actual social interactions

---

# Managing Expectations

- Be clear on what the purpose of using Minecraft is
- Set clear goals or expectations
- State the rules clearly
- Spend time learning how to manage student behaviour in Minecraft and ask for support
- Use your student's experience to help you

---

# Some recommended rules

- No Griefing ([See this link for description](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Griefing))
- No Profanity or obscenities (in chat or otherwise)
- No player-made servers, unless you are asked to
- Work towards your goal, don't let yourself be distracted
- Remember that you are still in a classroom! All the normal rules apply!

# Existing Resources (The Library)

Minecraft Education comes with a *Library* of pre-made levels and experiences from other educators. These can be found and downloaded directly inside of minecraft in the Library.

Further to this there are lesson plans available on the [Explore Lessons Online Website](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/resources/explore-lessons).

---

# Creating your own resources

- One of the great benefits of Minecraft is the ability to create new experiences.
- Ideally do this in collaboration with your class
- Building is only one part of the process, there's also scope to create characters and challenges.
- Good levels allow some freedom of movement and choice but provide students with story and intrigue.

---

# An example from CS
- In year 7, Computer Science students work in a world consisting of 10 challenges
- Students must program an Agent to complete challenges for them
- Initially students must follow the structure, but tasks become more open ended as they go on.
