## What is ChatGPT and how does it work?

GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer."

Transformer is a type of neural network architecture that uses attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input text when making predictions about the next word.

<!--     
- Introduce the topic of GPT and what it stands for.
- Explain what a transformer is and how it works in layman terms.

## What will the future look like?

Before ChatGPT there was GPT-1 (117M), GPT-2 (1.2B) and GPT-3 (175B)

ChatGPT is a step inbetween GPT-3 and GPT-4

GPT-4 will be trained on something greater than 100 Trillion Parameters

## Will ChatGPT and similar tools be free forever?

Most likely not. 

OpenAI and others do not stand to gain much by offering this for free for the long run.

OpenAI are running the 'Silicon Valley business model' right now. Recently they have introduced a freemium model $20US for premium access.

## Yes, this looks useful for me... but what about Students using it?

We can't avoid the use of AI tools, it's almost inevitable.

Some students will inevitably use this tool to cheat.
But there is not much point in having an arms race.

We are in the business of education, we will need to educate students on the reasons for and against using these tools ethically and responsibly.

2. How will you address this with your students?
3. How can you use this for postive impact?
4. How can negative impacts be minimised?
