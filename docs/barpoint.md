    [![Martin Davies](./Assets/Handbook%20SOW%20template%20Notes.png){align="right" style="height:230px;"}](https://kelletthk-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/hchan_kellettschool_com/Documents/2022-2023/AH%20docs/Working%20Parties/Department%20Handbook%20and%20SoW%20Template.docx?d=wd12694f7ad4947a790b2a2889cfa781a&csf=1&web=1&e=pcPG7o)

    Martin actively contributed to the development of a new department handbook and Statement of Work (SoW) template. The goal was to establish a standardized approach across all departments, enhancing the consistency of documentation. By ensuring uniformity in the handbooks, staff members will have an easier time navigating and utilizing them across departments. The final document was utilized to update the existing handbooks and SoWs for all employees.

##### Tech Training

    During staff induction week 2022-23, Martin conducted multiple training sessions to familiarize new staff members with the use of technology at Kellett. The sessions covered various topics, including the use of iPads, particularly GoodNotes and iPad usage for Year 7 students. Additionally, Martin provided overviews on connecting iPads to Fujitsu boards and using Fujitsu and Domview whiteboard screens.

##### AI (CPD)

!!! abstract "Led training on Artificial Intelligence for feedback, marking and assessment CPD group"
    [![Martin Davies](./Assets/Poe%20video.png){width="30%" align="right" style="clear: right;"}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wpIm4et-h0)

    Martin conducted a training session for the CPD group focused on utilizing custom AI bots to enhance teacher feedback, grading, and assessment. He demonstrated the practicality of this approach by creating a bot in real-time to aid in marking. The session also explored the possibility of personalized learning for students through subject-specific AI bots. The response from the staff was highly positive, with many recognizing the potential and advantages of this technology.

    Martin also produced a resource for teachers, including the innovation staff on how to create custom chatbots using poe.com

##### AI (Fireside)

!!! abstract "Led a 'Fireside Friday' on Artificial Intelligence"
    [![Martin Davies](./Assets/ChatGPTv2Slides.png){width="30%" align="left" style="clear: left;"}](./Assets/chatGPT_v02.pdf)
    [![Martin Davies](./Assets/Chinese%20to%20English%20bot.png){width="30%" align="left" style="clear: left;"}](https://poe.com/ChineseToEnglishKS)
    
    This was Martin's first training session on the usage of Artificial Intelligence in schools, coinciding with the release of ChatGPT. Martin was eager to demonstrate the potential applications of this technology to staff and encourage meaningful conversations with students. During the session, Martin engaged in a conversation with a ChatGPT-powered chatbot, showcasing how to prompt it for desired responses. Notably, Martin collaborated with the Chinese department, using the chatbot to translate Mandarin text. 
    
    Subsequent conversation with members of the Chinese department resulted in Martin authoring a chatbot that the Chinese department could utilize for analyzing and discussing Chinese literature in English, which would be beneficial for English-speaking students learning Mandarin.

##### AI Transcription (Fireside)

!!! abstract "Led a 'Fireside Friday' on Artificial Intelligence and voice transcription for feedback"

    Martin led a further fireside friday talk focused around the use of an AI transcription tool called otter.ai which he uses to transcribe sections of his lessons with students in order to provide them with a summary of lesson content as well as fast, time of need, personalised feedback. Martin cautioned against the use of this AI 100% of the time, but rather to utilize it when appropriate and necessary, highlighting that for instance this would not be an appropriate tool for recording one on one conversations with students as data is not stored on school machines. Furthermore Martin stressed the need to carefully read and verify what the AI had transcribed and suggested in it's high level summaries.
