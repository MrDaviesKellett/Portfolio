!!! abstract "About Martin Davies"

    Martin Davies is a passionate computer science teacher with a unique blend of industry experience and teaching expertise. His journey began in the animation and visual effects industry, where he developed a strong foundation in programming and 3D animation. After transitioning to teaching, he has been able to bring his industry experience to the classroom, making computer science education more engaging and relevant to his students.

    With a passion for teaching and inspiring students, Martin has developed a teaching philosophy that is centered around creating a student-centered learning environment. He believes in encouraging active participation, critical thinking, and problem-solving in his students. Through his teaching, he aims to inspire and educate the next generation of computer scientists and programmers.

## Teaching Philosophy

Martin's teaching philosophy is deeply rooted in Assessment for Learning, inspired by the work of [Dylan William](https://www.dylanwiliam.org/Dylan_Wiliams_website/Welcome.html). He believes in creating a student-centered learning environment that encourages active participation, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Through formative assessment techniques, such as [diagnostic questioning](https://www.dylanwiliam.org/Dylan_Wiliams_website/Papers_files/DIMS%20%28NCME%202007%29.pdf) and mini-whiteboards, Martin guides his students towards a deeper understanding of computer science concepts.

Martin is a strong advocate for student autonomy and believes in giving students the freedom to take ownership of their learning. By providing opportunities for students to work on open-ended projects, he encourages them to think creatively and develop problem-solving skills. His teaching approach is centered around creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment, where students feel encouraged to ask questions and explore their curiosity.

## Industry Experience

## Teaching Experience

### Computer Science Teacher

![Martin Davies](./Assets/abstractCSconcepts.png){width="33%" align="left"}

As a computer science teacher, Martin has had the opportunity to inspire and educate students of various ages and skill levels. His teaching experience has equipped him with the ability to adapt his teaching style to meet the needs of diverse learners. Martin has taught a range of programming languages, including Python, Haskell, C# and Assembly languages.

One of his notable achievements is introducing **Coding** as a language option for Year 8 and 9 students instead of having a rigid and compulsary Computer Science course for these yeargroups. This innovative approach has proved to be an excellent choice, leading to better engagement in the subject and preparing students for the challenges of the Computer Science GCSE course in Year 10. By introducing coding at an earlier stage, Martin has been able to foster a strong foundation in programming concepts, enabling students to develop a deeper understanding of the subject and build a strong foundation for their future studies.

Martin's commitment to creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment has been instrumental in encouraging students to ask questions and explore their curiosity. Through his teaching, he aims to inspire and educate the next generation of computer scientists and programmers. He believes that by providing students with a solid foundation in programming concepts, he can empower them to succeed in the field of computer science. Martin's teaching approach is centered around creating a collaborative and inclusive learning environment, where students feel encouraged to work together, share ideas, and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. By doing so, he aims to equip his students with the skills, knowledge, and confidence required to excel in the field of computer science.

### Innovation as a Subject

The Innovation subject is a unique program that Martin has developed, designed to expose students to a range of thoughts, professions, and innovations across various fields. Students work on three projects each academic year, exploring topics like Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality Experiences, and Board Game Development. The focus is on developing transferable skills like resilience, problem-solving, and collaboration.

Through the Innovation subject, Martin aims to provide students with a platform to explore their creativity and develop their problem-solving skills. By working on open-ended projects, students are encouraged to think creatively and develop innovative solutions to real-world problems.

## Extracurricular Activities

### Blender Modelling ECA

The Blender Modelling ECA is an extracurricular activity that Martin leads, where students learn the basics of 3D modelling and animation using Blender. This activity provides students with an opportunity to explore their creative side, develop their problem-solving skills, and work collaboratively with their peers.

Through the Blender Modelling ECA, Martin aims to provide students with a platform to express their creativity and develop their skills in 3D modelling and animation. By doing so, he hopes to inspire students to pursue careers in the fields of computer graphics, animation, and visual effects.
